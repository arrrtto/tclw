tclw is a Linux BASH script to detect and notify about Pirate Chain's Treasure Chest and Lite Wallet apps (on Linux). That should work well on Debian-based operating systems, e.g. Debian, Linux Mint, Ubuntu, PopOS!, etc.

To make that script work, download it and put it into your Home folder's subfolder called bin. Or to some other location you like.
Then make sure it is executable and run it from Terminal.
