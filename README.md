tclw is a Linux BASH script to detect and notify about Pirate Chain's Treasure Chest and Lite Wallet apps (on Linux). That should work well on Debian-based operating systems, e.g. Debian, Linux Mint, Ubuntu, PopOS!, etc.

To make that script work:
1. Download it for example from here: https://github.com/arrrtto/tclw/blob/main/tclw
(click the small down-arrow icon)
3. Move the downloaded tclw.sh file to the folder /usr/local/bin/
4. Right-click on it -> Properties -> Permissions -> tick the box "Allow executing file as program" -> Close
5. Open Terminal and enter this command: **tclw**
and press Enter. That should do the needful.


Another way to "install" the script is to do it completely via Terminal.
Open Terminal and execute this (Copy-paste):

**cd /usr/local/bin && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arrrtto/tclw/main/tclw.sh && chmod +x tclw**

and then you can just execute: **tclw**
and it will do the needful :)
